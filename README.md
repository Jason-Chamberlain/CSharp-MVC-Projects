# CSharp-MVC-Projects
This repository contains introductory concept projects completed during the C# and .NET course at [The Tech Academy](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/). Through these projects, essential skills in web application development using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture were gained. This architectural pattern separates the application logic into three interconnected components: Models (data and business logic), Views (user interface), and Controllers (handling user input and managing the flow). MVC is a fundamental concept widely used in real-world software development, particularly in web application development.

## NewsletterAppMVC

[Link to NewsletterAppMVC README](./CSharp-MVC-NewsletterAppMVC/README.md)

The NewsletterAppMVC is a simple web application created using ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework Database First. It includes two main controllers, `HomeController` for user sign-up and `AdminController` for administrative functions. The project offers views for user sign-up and subscription management. By working on this project, insights were gained into ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, form handling, controller actions, view rendering, and basic security principles. It was a great starting point for learning web application development.

## Car Insurance Web Application

This project is a web application developed using ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework. It includes controllers for basic actions and an `InsureeController` for managing insurance-related functionalities. The application uses models like `Admin` and `QuoteVM` to handle data, and it features various views for user interaction. The Entity Framework Database First approach is used for database interactions. Through this project, knowledge about web application development and database integration was aquired.
